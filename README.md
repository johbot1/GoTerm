    `https://go.dev/dl/`
- To check if you have Go installed properly, open a command line and enter:  
    `go version`

## How To Run:
- Download the files from this github and unzip them
- Navigate to the unzipped folder in a command terminal
- Use the following command to run the project:  
`go run .`
- If you wish to build an executable for repeated tests, run this command:  
`go build main.go`


# FEEDBACK
~~- add gitignore~~
~~- remove .idea files~~
- add better error display
- better feedback for handling error input
~~- Fix retry screen (y reruns the entire program)~~
~~- Add constants for numbers~~
- move generate number to play method
  - Ceiling and other things (Play should take either only 1 or ALL params)
